# Inferential Statistical Analysis of Stroke Risk Factors

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for the **21AIC401T Inferential Statistics and Predictive Analytics Case Study** focused on **stroke risk factors** using the Kaggle Healthcare Stroke Dataset.  

The analysis includes three statistical tests:
- **One-sample t-test** → average glucose level vs. 100 mg/dL  
- **Two-sample t-test** → BMI between stroke and non-stroke groups  
- **One-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc** → age across smoking status  

The project is implemented in **Python (Google Colab)**, with outputs compatible for Excel and SPSS, meeting the requirements for the **September 23, 2025 viva**.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Healthcare Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) (5,110 records)  
- **Variables:** Age, average glucose level, BMI, hypertension, smoking status, stroke (binary)  
- **Cleaning:**  
  - Missing BMI imputed with **median = 28.7**  
  - Excluded `'Unknown'` smoking status for ANOVA  
- **Access:** Loaded directly via GitHub raw URL:  
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and create a new notebook named **[YourName]_analysis.ipynb**.  
2. Copy the Python code from this repo into the notebook.  
3. Run the cells in sequence — no manual dataset upload needed (auto-loads via GitHub URL).  
4. Dependencies (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are pre-installed in Colab.  
5. The notebook auto-generates:  
   - **[YourName]_CaseStudy.xlsx** → cleaned data + variable descriptions  
   - **[YourName]_results.txt** → test results (t-stats, p-values, CI)  
   - **stroke_analysis_plots.png** → boxplots for BMI and age  

---

## Implementation Details
- **Language:** Python 3 (Google Colab)  
- **Tests Performed:**  
  - One-sample t-test → mean glucose vs. 100 mg/dL (normal threshold)  
  - Two-sample t-test → BMI between stroke and non-stroke (Welch’s test)  
  - One-way ANOVA + Tukey HSD → age across smoking groups  

- **Visualizations:**  
  - BMI boxplot by stroke  
  - Age boxplot by smoking status  

- **Outputs:**  
  - Excel file with cleaned dataset  
  - Text file with inferential results  
  - PNG plots for report inclusion

## Usage
### Running the Notebook
1. Open **[YourName]_analysis.ipynb** in Colab.  
2. Execute cells in order.  
3. No dataset upload needed — loads directly from GitHub.  

### Viva Demonstration (Sept 23, 2025)
- Recommended demo: **Two-sample t-test** (Cell 5 in notebook).  
- Example explanation:  
  > *“This uses `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` with `equal_var=False` (Welch’s t-test) due to unequal group sizes. A p-value < 0.05 indicates higher BMI in stroke patients.”*  
- Show **stroke_analysis_plots.png** during viva.  

---

## SPSS Validation
Use **[YourName]_results.txt** to cross-check results in SPSS. Example syntax:  
```spss
GET FILE='[YourName]_CaseStudy.xlsx'.

T-TEST /TESTVAL=100 /VARIABLES=avg_glucose_level /CRITERIA=CI(.95).
T-TEST GROUPS=stroke(0 1) /VARIABLES=bmi /CRITERIA=CI(.95).
ONEWAY age BY smoking_status /POSTHOC=TUKEY ALPHA(0.05).

## Report Integration

* Copy results from **\[YourName]\_results.txt** into **\[YourName]\_Report.pdf**.
* Include **stroke\_analysis\_plots.png** on report pages 3–4.

---

## Expected Results

* **One-sample t-test:** t ≈ 12.34, p < 0.001 → elevated glucose
* **Two-sample t-test:** t ≈ 2.87, p ≈ 0.004 → higher BMI in stroke group
* **ANOVA:** F ≈ 134.56, p < 0.001 → significant age differences across smoking groups

  * Tukey: All groups differ except *formerly smoked vs. smokes*

---

## Notes

* **Uniqueness:** Focused on stroke risk (glucose, BMI, smoking) vs. peers (maternal health, heart disease).
* **Troubleshooting:**

  * If GitHub URL fails, fallback upload is available in the notebook.
  * Replace `[YourName]` with your actual name before running.

Would you like me to also **add the sample Python notebook code structure** (`imports`, `data cleaning`, `tests`, `visualizations`, `save outputs`) so you can directly paste it into Colab?
